This is a list of little apps and scripts that take away some pain points in my life. Or, they are just fun.

# Eduk8me Labs currently available

* [Online clocks](https://eduk8me.github.io/clocks) - ChatGPT helped me create two online clocks. The first shows the current date and time, while the second shows a countdown to a specific event. The countdown page was created to bring in a countdown clock into OBS as a browser source.
* [Time Traveler's Age Calculator](https://eduk8me.github.io/calcage/) - With a lot of help from ChatGPT, this one page web app will calculate your age and the date when you reach certain number of days milestones (5,000 days up to 30,000 days in 5,000 day increments).
* [Ultra-Secure Password Generator](https://eduk8me.github.io/pwgen/) - The ultra-secure was a ChatGPT suggestion. I can't guarantee that you won't get hacked, but if you use a different 5 word password on every site you are doing better than most! This is a single page app, nothing is sent to any server.
* [Words Highlighter](https://labs.eduk8.me/words/) - Another creation with the help of ChatGPT. You paste your text into the box and a list of comma separated words in the second box, and the page will highlight the words in the text. Another single page app, it runs on your local machine and not the server.

## Bookmarklets

Bookmarklets are bookmarks that run Javascript code. They can be used to replace extensions for a lot of uses plus they are easy to install and uninstall. To install, drag the link to your bookmark bar. To uninstall, right-click on the bookmarklet and delete. Here are some of my favorites:

* QR Code Creator
* Copy Title and URL 
* Archive.is
