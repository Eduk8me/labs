# Eduk8me Labs

I experimented with a ton of things over the Christmas break in 2023, so I decided to bring some structure to the chaos and create a Labs website where I can document my findings or share them.

# Eduk8me Labs currently available

* [Ultra-Secure Password Generator](https://eduk8me.github.io/pwgen/) - The ultra-secure was a ChatGPT suggestion. I can't guarantee that you won't get hacked, but if you use a different 5 word password on every site you are doing better than most! This is a single page app, nothing is sent to any server.
* [Words Highlighter](https://labs.eduk8.me/words/) - Another creation with the help of ChatGPT. You paste your text into the box and a list of comma separated words in the second box, and the page will highlight the words in the text. Another single page app, it runs on your local machine and not the server.
* [Time Traveler's Age Calculator](https://eduk8me.github.io/calcage/) - With a lot of help from ChatGPT, this one page web app will calculate your age and the date when you reach certain number of days milestones (5,000 days up to 30,000 days in 5,000 day increments).

## Bookmarklets

Bookmarklets are bookmarks that run Javascript code. They can be used to replace extensions for a lot of uses plus they are easy to install and uninstall. To install, drag the link to your bookmark bar. To uninstall, right-click on the bookmarklet and delete. Here are some of my favorites:

* QR Code Creator
* Copy Title and URL 
* Archive.is

You can [see all of the bookmarklets here](/bookmarklets/)!
