# A web based clock and countdown timer

Two little web based apps I cooked up with help from ChatGPT. Both of these apps run locally in your browser and store their settings in the URL. Once you have a page set up the way you like, you can bookmark it or share the URL with others and they'll see the customized version.

Each app has a settings panel that shows when mousing over the bottom right of the screen. There is a [Github Repo](https://github.com/Eduk8me/clocks) repo available along with a [website](https://eduk8me.github.io/clocks/).

## clock.html

This shows a [digital clock](https://eduk8me.github.io/clocks/clock.html) on screen which can be customized in a few different ways.

## countdown.html

The [countdown timer](https://eduk8me.github.io/clocks/countdown.html) was created to bring a timer into OBS through a browser source, but it also works on its own to show a countdown on screen.
