I added a [bookmarklet to add the current page to an Outlook calendar event](https://labs.eduk8.me/bookmarklets/). However, Outlook Calendar doesn't let you create a new event from parameters, so the bookmarklet can only open up Outlook Calendar. It's not totally useless, it will copy the current page address and any highlighted text to the clipboard so you can paste it into your new event.
